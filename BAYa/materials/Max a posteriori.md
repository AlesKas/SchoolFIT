We try to generate the most likely parameters of the posterior probability distribution that we've got. Using the Bayesian theorem we can turn this question into finding the parameter that with the highest probability generates the original distribution.
$$\hat{\eta}^{MAP} = arg_{\eta}max\text{ }p(\eta|X) = arg_{\eta}max\text{ }p(X|\eta)\text{ }p(\eta)$$
