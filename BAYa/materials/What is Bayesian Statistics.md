## Theorem
Bayesian Theorem describes probability of an event based on previous knowledge of conditions associated with this event. The formula goes as follows:
$$
	Posterior = { Likelihood \text{ } \times \text { } Prior \over Evidence }
$$
$$
P(A|B) = {P(B|A) * P(A) \over P(B)}
$$
## Bayesian vs Frequentist statistics
[Are you Bayesian or Frequentist?](https://towardsdatascience.com/statistics-are-you-bayesian-or-frequentist-4943f953f21b)
Frequentist approach assigns probabilities to data. It represents the frequency of occurences in an infinitely reoccuring event. It is better than Bayesian if there is a lot of data available.
Bayesian approach assigns probabilities to hypotheses. It's used for events that have either never happened or they we don't observe their result. They allow to test faster. They are immune to peeking at data.
